	<h3>What is this?</h3>
	<p>Cameron is the any time pick-me-up service. It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">markov chains</a> to generate compliments for when you're not feeling your best. You can read more on <a href="/about">/about</a>.</p>

	<h3>Where do I start?</h3>
	<p>We've got some <a href="/docs">documentation</a> on how to use Cameron. It's fairly simple and only takes a minute to start feeling the love.</p>

	<h3>I want to help.</h3>
	<p>Awesome, I love you.<br>
		Head over to <a href="https://github.com/trmml/cameron">GitHub</a> and read
		some issues and featured requests. If you can contribute then go all in for the pull request B)</p>

	<h3>Why does this site look like trash?</h3>
	<p>I've been working on it for less than a week + I'm almost useless with web design.
		Feel free to help me fix the awful code I've written for styling, though.</p>
